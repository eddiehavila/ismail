"""Hum a part into a voice note (ledger:M163, the Live DJ's handoff 52). Nate, 2026-10-06: "if I hummed or sung
something into the voice notes on mobile, couldn't you also analyze that and get my rough sketch of notes plus timing
that is synchronized with the playback". No hold-to-hum button: a hum is recognised from the note itself.

This part is the plumbing: decode a note, and tell a hum from talk by how it sounds and how few words it holds. The
master under every note is saved by the server (<id>_ref.wav), so the music that bleeds into the mic can line the
note up with the beat he heard; the measuring (alignment, notes, grid, swing) is the Live DJ's and joins here when it
has proved itself on real hums.

The thresholds are first guesses, to be replaced by what the phone mic and the Dime 3 headset actually measure."""
