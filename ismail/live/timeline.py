"""The live queue: clips on tracks, in beats. Pure logic, no audio, no threads.

Bar 1 starts at beat 0 when the engine starts. A clip is a block of notes `length` beats long that repeats
`loop` times (None = until replaced). One rule decides every conflict: a clip queued on a track at beat S
replaces what that track would play from S on. Clips that start at or after S are removed; a clip still
playing at S is cut at S (notes it started before S ring out). A stop is the same rule with nothing after.
