# Sound design in ismail

For acoustic and electric instruments (guitar, strings, piano, brass, voice, crowd) read `references/instruments.md` first: this file is mostly about sprite (the `synth` type) and drum-synth patches.

`instrument_help(type)` and `fx_help()` list every parameter with defaults. Start from a preset (`presets_list`) and change three or four things; a full patch from scratch is rarely better.

## Voices: instruments written as code

`voices_list` first: a built-in voice (grand_piano, growl, sfx ...) may already be the sound you need, and `voice_help(name)` shows what its velocity does. When you engineer an instrument as code that the song will reuse, write it as a voice module in `<project>/voices/<name>.py` (the engine looks in the project's `voices/` and in
`$ISMAIL_VOICES`; a song that keeps its voices in `songs/<slug>/voices/` has `build.py` copy them into
`proj/voices/`) (a `voice(freq, t, vel, gate, sr)` function plus an `INFO` dict), not as a `code` string in the track: the project stays portable, edits re-render automatically, and the voice can later move into the library. Never paste absolute paths or `sys.path` hacks into a `code` instrument.

A **performer** voice plays a whole part: `perform(notes, total_n, sr, bpm=120, lanes=None, beat0=0.0, **params)` and no `voice()`. Take `beat0` (the song beat at sample 0) and draw each note's randomness (humanize, pick, drift, noise) from a generator keyed on the note's song beat and pitch, as `voices/guitar/electric.py` `_rng` does, never from one generator drawn note after note: a render of any slice of the part (a bar range, the live engine's bar chunks) then plays exactly as the whole part does. Noise that runs under the whole part (a snare's wires) is drawn per block of the song's own timeline (`kit70._wire_noise`).

A voice renders the same in the whole song, in a bar range and live only if it follows five rules (found joining
windowed renders of a 146-bar song, `songs/tambopata`):
1. **Seed by song time**, never by where a note sits in the buffer: `beat0` plus the note's start, rounded once
   (`round((st + beat0 * 60 / bpm) * 1000)`, song milliseconds), not two rounded sample counts added.
2. **Never index notes by their place in the list**: a window gets only its own notes and a few before. Carry the
   identity in the note.
3. **A held note arrives cut**: a note that began before the window comes in at the window's first sample with
   what is left of it. A song-long bed generates by absolute time (noise per frame seeded by the frame's song
   number, fades over the song's first seconds), not by the note.
4. **Length-dependent work changes the sound**: a voice that draws noise for the whole buffer or filters it
   zero-phase sounds different when it is given a different length. ismail hands code voices each note whole; a
   performer still gets the window, so keep its draws per note and its filters causal.
5. **A window's last bar is not the song**: notes after it are absent and it fades out; compare windows at a join,
   not over their last bar.
Studio renders of songs using `electric` or `kit70` made before their seeds were keyed (late September 2026) are a
different take of the same humanization: a blind exam's old clips cannot be rendered again exactly.

## Gain staging

One synth voice peaks near -9 dBFS and one drum hit near -6 dBFS at full velocity, so faders at 0 dB are a sane start. Chords of 4 notes with unison add up: pads usually sit at -8 to -12 dB. Check `render` output: every track peak under 0 dBFS, master limiter gain reduction under ~6 dB. A limiter pulling 10+ dB means your faders are too hot; turn tracks down, not the limiter.

## Recipes by role

| role | start | key parameters |
|---|---|---|
| kick | `{"type": "kick"}` | pitch_end = key root around 38-55 Hz, pitch_start 90-160, pitch_decay 0.02-0.05, decay 0.25-0.45, click 0.1-0.4, drive 3-6 dB |
| snare | `{"type": "snare"}` | tone_hz 130-200 (the body), tone_mix 0.35-0.55, noise_hp 300-2000, noise_decay 0.15-0.35 |
| hat | `{"type": "hat"}` | decay 0.03 closed / 0.2 open, hp 1.5-8 kHz, metal 0.5-0.9; add `chorus` or `tremolo mode=pan` for width |
| bass | saw + sine sub at octave -1 | lp24 400-1600 Hz, mono true, glide 0.02; fx `{"type": "eq", "bands": [{"type": "lowcut", "freq": 40}]}`; `duck` source=kick depth -6 to -12 dB |
| stabs / riff | saw unison 3-4, detune 10-25 cents | lp24 1-3 kHz, filter env_amount 0.5-1.5 oct (4 oct makes every note a bright click), amp s 0.5-0.8 so gaps don't open |
| pad | saw unison 3-5 + noise 0.1-0.3 | lp 1.5-3 kHz, amp a 0.005-0.6, s 0.3-0.8, chorus + reverb send -8 dB |
| lead | square pw 0.3 + saw | lp 3-6 kHz with env, delay 0.75 beats pingpong, reverb send |
| voice (sung vowel) | saw + pulse + noise 0.04 | fx `formant` vowel '@' / 'e' / 'a' (see analyze_formants), vibrato lfo pitch 5 Hz depth 0.1 delay 0.3 |
| voice (words) | `sound_speak(text)` on a muted track as audio clips | `vocoder` fx on a synth track, modulator = that track; speech is short, so hold vowels with a formant voice |

Drum synths are mono; width comes from effects. Sidechain feel: `duck` with `source='kick'` is deterministic and cheap; `compressor` with `sidechain` reacts to the kick's audio.

## Designing against a target sound

1. Get a clean target: `sound_extract(name, source, bars, step, every=, length_sec=)` averages every occurrence of an event at one grid position. Consistency near 1 means an identical sample each time; below 0.5 means the event is buried or varies (pick other bars or steps).
2. `instrument_fit(target='sound:<name>', instrument=..., params={path: [lo, hi]}, notes=<what the target plays>, fx=[...], fmin=, fmax=)`. It fits spectrum, envelope, stereo width and pitch clarity. Fx parameters fit too (`fx.0.depth_db`). Use `fmin` to ignore bleed (for example kick sub under a snare).
3. Read the comparison it prints: `<<` bands are where you are too quiet. A fit that pins a parameter at a range edge is telling you the range is wrong or the architecture is missing something (the pad fit pinning noise at max meant the target has an air layer).
4. Apply, then check the sound in the song, not alone.

## Tuning a track in the mix

`track_fit(track, params, bars)` renders the track with the rest of its stem group over a window and scores it against the reference stem (perceptual + bands). Use it only where the reference stem is clean (an intro with one instrument, for example). Pin `volume_db` unless level is the question: the learned metric can be bought with loudness.

## Effects order that works

instrument -> eq (cleanup) -> distortion -> filter -> duck/compressor -> chorus -> delay; reverb on a bus with sends. Master: limiter last, ceiling -1.0 dB for anything that becomes an mp3 (`references/mastering.md`). A drum bus (tracks output to a bus with compressor attack ~8 ms, ratio 3, plus a short room reverb mix 0.1) glues drums; fast attack plus clipping made them worse in testing.

## Guitars and other played strings

Learned matching a 1970 guitar record until 20 of 22 single notes passed a blind exam (`references/blind-tests.md`).

- Start from the library: `voice_help(name='electric')` (guitar or bass) and `voice_help(name='kit70')` list presets and the rig each was fitted with. The voice is the DI signal; without its rig it sounds like a synth. Presets: `strat70_lead`, `strat70_rhythm`, `strat70_rotary`, `pbass70`, `kit70` (`track_add(..., instrument='preset:strat70_lead')`), then `fx_add` the rig's effects in order.
- The rig effects are `wah`, `fuzz`, `univibe`, `amp`, `cab`, `rotary`, `tape`; `fx_help(type='amp')` documents each. They play live as in the studio.
- `electric` is tuned a half step down by default (guitar Eb2-Eb6, bass Eb1-G3), as on the record it was fitted to; set `tuning` (MIDI notes of the open strings, low to high) for E standard. `kit70` plays General MIDI drum numbers (36 kick, 38 snare, 42/44/46 hats, 49/57 crashes, 51 ride; `voice_help` has the full map).
- Rig order: wah -> fuzz -> amp -> cab -> delay -> eq for a lead (wah before the fuzz, as on the record); univibe before the amp; a rotary speaker after the cab. Amp noise (`hiss_db`, `hum_db`) belongs in a lead: "too clean" was the most common tell.
- **Put the parts in the record's register before fitting any tone.** Measure the pitch percentiles of each reference part and move voicings and the bass line there first. Two tone fits failed until the notes moved; register masquerades as tone.
- **Fit the harmonic profile, not the long-term spectrum.** A long-term spectrum mostly measures which notes were played. The level of each harmonic relative to the fundamental, averaged over notes, is note-independent: fitting it took a bass from 8.6 to 4.6 dB off.
- **Separated stems are dark above about 1.5 kHz.** A correction measured on the stem cut the top while the user heard "upper harmonics too muted". When a stem-based timbre number and the ear disagree, the ear wins.
- **Fitting a rig fast:** grid the nonlinear settings (gain, fuzz, drive), fit the linear stages (tone stack, cab, eq) on the spectral envelope for each grid point, then polish the best few with real renders. Minutes, where one global fit over every knob took hours.
- A fit that pins at a range edge is a missing mechanism (a pickup's tone-knob resonance, a velocity-sensing pickup, treble that dies faster than the fundamental), not a range to widen.
